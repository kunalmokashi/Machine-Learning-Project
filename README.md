# Machine-Learning-Project
Machie Learning Course Project
Interpolating/Predicting missing features.
(Dataset - Many Labs project dataset, replicating psychological studies.) 

The original Many Labs project (https://osf.io/ct89g/) attempted to replicate
28 psychological studies, across 60 different labs, trying to determine to what extent the originally studied effect
was reproducible.


Implemented a Probabilistic graphical model to learn the structure of the data. Implemented Chow Liu Algorithm to learn a dependency tree and marginalized for missing feature values. 

Categorical features encoded using One Hot Encoding.
